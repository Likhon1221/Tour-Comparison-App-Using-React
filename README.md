For this project, I’ll be developing a Tour Comparison App that fetches tour data from an API and displays it through an interactive and dynamic interface. The app will allow users to explore available tours, remove those they aren’t interested in, and toggle detailed information for each tour. This project will be a great way for me to demonstrate my skills in API interaction, state management, and React component design.
